## Arduino Code

The arduino code controls the syringe pumpâ€™s flow rate, LED indicators, and forward/backward movement. The code used can be found [here](https://github.com/allihoying/syringe_code/blob/main/Ardunio_code). 

## Operating Instructions

1. Plug in the power supply  
2. In the arduino code, set the flow rate and syringe diameter variables to the desired values  
3. Plug the arduino into a computer and upload the code  
4. Load the syringe into the pump (the forward and backward buttons can be used to move the carriage into the correct position to fit the syringe)  
5. Press the power button to start the pump  
6. Press the power button again to pause the pump  
7. Watch the LED indicator to see the pump status. It will be green while running, yellow while paused, and red when empty.
